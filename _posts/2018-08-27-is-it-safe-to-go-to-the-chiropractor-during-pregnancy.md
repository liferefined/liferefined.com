We know that the strain of pregnancy and carrying a child can put some serious strain on your back! After all, your body undergoes some serious rearranging to make space for that little baby!

If you're like most women, you've likely experienced some level of [back pain](http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-health/back-pain-during-pregnancy/) over the course of your pregnancy.

What if you already had poor posture, scoliosis or were overweight before you became pregnant?

This pain may be even more challenging to deal with.

Usually, this pain is caused by a sudden surge in your hormones, a forward-tilted center of gravity, a change in your posture, and -- you guessed it -- stress and anxiety.

But can you see a chiropractor [during pregnancy](https://www.liferefined.com/2018/05/21/baby-formula/)?

That's what this post is all about. If you've ever asked yourself:

> _"Can I go to the chiropractor while pregnant?"_

then you need to keep reading. We'll also let you know where you can find the [top chiropractic care](https://www.liferefined.com/meet-us/) for yourself as well as the other members of your family.

## Is It Safe to Go to Chiropractor When Pregnant?
Let's begin by answering the most important question of them all: can you go to the chiropractor while pregnant?

In a word: **yes**. In two words: you _should_.

Prenatal massage has been heralded as an effective way to ease the symptoms and stress of pregnancy for decades now. You should think of chiropractic care as an even more efficient and effective way to see those benefits.

Remember that chiropractic care doesn't involve any kind of drugs/medication or going under the knife.

Plus, you'll see the benefits not just in your back, but throughout your entire body. In fact - your baby benefits, too.

## The Benefits of a Chiropractic Adjustment during Pregnancy
Now that you understand that it's safe to see a chiropractor during pregnancy, let's take a look at the benefits of doing so.

First of all, you'll finally get relief from the debilitating pain that's making it tough for you to resume your regular daily activities. Remember that this pain is likely caused by the pressure that's put on your spine and nerves as your bodies' center of gravity changes as you gain weight.

A pregnant belly also drastically increases the overall curvature of your spine -- which seriously messes with your posture.

In addition to relief from back pain, you'll likely also see relief in the neck and the shoulders.

If you suffer from [morning sickness](https://www.self.com/story/morning-sickness-facts)?

Going to the chiropractor while pregnant may be able to help with that, too.

Sometimes, the real reason why you're vomiting so much is because you actually have a pinched nerve in your vertebrae. Heading to the chiropractor can quickly and safely remedy that situation.

Of course, one of the biggest reasons why so many women go to the chiropractor while pregnant is because they're able to better prepare for labor and delivery. The other big reason? Ensuring proper alignment and body function helps your baby get the best environment in which to grow and develop.

Some evidence even suggests that getting chiropractic adjustments may decrease the chance of you having to have a C-section. It will also safely and gently position your hips and pelvis to ensure the most optimal environment for your baby to grow and develop and be positioned for delivery.

Best of all?

There have been numerous studies done that prove that the right adjustments can even [shorten your overall labor time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647084/).

We can guarantee that's certainly something that you're interested in.

The only thing that you should be on the lookout for if you're considering seeing a chiropractor while you're pregnant?

Make sure you talk to your medical professional and OB/GYN if you're dealing with bleeding, toxemia, or if you have an ectopic pregnancy.

These are the few and sporadic conditions that might make it [a bit more complicated](https://www.liferefined.com/2018/04/23/when-to-stop-seeing-a-chiropractor/) for you to see a chiropractor while you're expecting, but certainly not impossible. Just make certain your chiropractor is aware of these conditions.

## Other Ways to Minimize Back Pain during Pregnancy
Now that we've covered visiting a chiropractor during pregnancy?

Let's quickly talk about a few of the other ways in which you can manage your back pain while you're expecting.

You may want to invest in a [pregnancy pillow](https://parentinghealthybabies.com/15-must-know-pregnancy-pillow-benefits/) to make you more comfortable and to reduce the level of cramps you feel across your back and lower body in general.

If you drop something on the ground, be cautious bending over at the waist to pick it up. Doing so can put more stress on your spine.

Instead, squat down to pick up the item.

You should speak with both your medical doctor and your chiropractor while pregnant to ask if there are exercises and workout routines that you can do.

This will help to make your back and your abs a bit stronger. Plus, it's also a serious mood-booster.

Finally, you may want to invest in a support belt (also known as a belly band.) This will offer your abs and lower back cushion and serious support. Plus, they'll also help you to make sure that you're keeping your posture in the right place.
