I’m continually encouraging people to live their life consciously by asking questions that examine the reasons behind the decisions they make.  Earlier today I asked someone who was in the office to get checked and adjusted, “What are you open to receiving from today’s adjustment?”  Their answer wasn’t an uncommon one, in fact it’s one I hear every day, but yesterday it struck a chord with me.  He answered “To make certain everything in my nerve system is functioning properly.”

Those that know me and our office know that he hit several of my favorite key terms when it comes to Chiropractic care;  nerve system and function.  Often times that would be all it took put you in my good graces and we would have been onto our checkup; but not today.

I have a dental cleaning tomorrow and I know along with this cleaning comes a check-up by the Dentist. That check-up is obviously very important because I want to know if there is any underlying issues that need to be addressed as soon as possible.  But the real reason I look forward to this appointment is that I know I will walk out of that office BETTER than I was when I went in. They will clean and polish my pearly whites and have my smile at 100% when I leave.

That’s the goal for everyone that enter’s our office – that they leave a better version of themselves than they were when they came in.  Even if you’re already having a great day when you come for your adjustment at Lakeshore, we all want you to have an experience that lifts you up and moves you closer to your 100%.

How close are you the best version of yourself right now?  Would you like to be closer to your 100%? Good, I’ll look forward to serving you soon.
