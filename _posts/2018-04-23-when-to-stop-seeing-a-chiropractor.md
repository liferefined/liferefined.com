Wait! I bet you think you know where I'm going with his, but let me answer this with another question. "What's your goal for getting checked and adjusted by your Chiropractor?"

I don't even remember why my Dad took me to the Chiropractor when I was young. Dr. Phil Gilbert in Huntingburg, IN routinely took care of my hard working father, but somehow I ended up on his table getting checked somewhere around the age of 8 or 9. I went along a few times a year after that and always enjoyed the experience. By the time I was in middle school, I was working in Dad's factory and finally able to procure my first dirt bike. Between the physical labor of work, playing football and jumping dry dams in the fields behind my house on my 250cc Honda, I recall going to see Dr. Gilbert much more regularly.

I, like most who see a Chiropractor, would go in and ask Dr. Gilbert to put me back together after I'd beat myself up playing hard. During football season I had a weekly appointment and out of season I got in every 2-3 weeks. My goal - KEEP PLAYING HARD.

Fast forward 30 years and now Dr. Staci and I are seeing kids with ear infections, teen athletes, moms with migraines or fibromyalgia, dads with low back pain and sciatica that's affecting their golf game and grandmothers who want to be able to get up from the floor without pain after playing with their grand babies.

Our recommendations are based on two things: where you start (the evaluation and exams we perform), and the goals you want to achieve. Are you fed up with your headaches, tired of waking up with tingling fingers, or sick of that aching spot at the base of your neck? It's going to take at least 3-6 months to get to a point where this is no longer a regular threat. If you discontinue your care as soon as the pain is gone, it unfortunately often returns in a similar time fashion.

Wait, this is the  catch you've been waiting for....right?  But come on.... how reasonable is it for you to think that you'd never need to wear a retainer after you get your braces off?

Likewise, if you'd like to simply get your headaches, back pain or sciatica to cease - we'll tell you how long that will take. As well as how long you can expect that to last before structure and neurologic changes revert and you wind up in the same place you started. I've said for years, "there's no massage, diet or exercise plan that will correct your improper neck curve. In fact, no one else is trained to do so with a nerve system perspective outside the Chiropractic profession."
You want it gone for good?

We do too! And we'll also tell you what we believe will accomplish that goal.

The good news is....

We'll never recommend one more adjustment than what we expect it to take to help you be your best - but we'll never recommend one less adjustment, either.

One final question: When will you stop brushing your teeth?
