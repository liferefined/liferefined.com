> "You are what you eat."

We’ve all heard it, but do we really believe it?  There was a poster on the wall of my grade school cafeteria that showed a boy eating a piece of chicken and on top of his head was that red, pointy thing that’s on top of a chicken’s head (the farm boy in me wants you to know that’s called a “comb.”) I remember thinking how silly that was and it somewhat discouraged the notion it was trying to portray. 20 years later I sat in an auditorium in Philadelphia listening to Dr. James Chestnut, one of my mentors, who was telling us how when his daughter once asked if she could have McDonalds he simply said “Honey, your body uses everything you eat to make cells that keep you alive and functioning. Do you want those beautiful eyes of yours made out of fatty hamburgers and French fries or broccoli, carrots and apples?” Needless to say I’ve used this like with Trent and Drake a couple times.

So if we are what we eat, shouldn’t we be concerned about what the cow we are eating ate as well?  YES! While blasphemous coming from a farming community that grows the GMO crops that are turned into livestock feed, I assure you that the healthiest cows are not the ones consuming the “fortified” feed.  Same goes for chickens, lamb, bison, turkey and even fish.  So what’s so different about grass feed meats vs. grain fed?

## Polyunsaturated Fat

Grass-fed meats have been shown to contain slightly higher amounts of polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), but the bigger benefit here is the composition of those PUFAs are higher in the most beneficial fatty acids.  Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is known for its antioxidant activities and has been linked to protecting against heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  Grass-fed will contain 2 to 3 times more CLA than grain-fed beef, which should be one of our best sources of this valuable fatty acid.

## The Omega Difference

Grass-fed meats have significantly higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.  Depending on the breed of cow, grass-fed beef can contain 2 to 5 times more omega-3s than the grain-fed beef. The good news is that recent studies are saying that the inflammatory omega-6 concentrations in the grain fed and grass fed remain fairly similar.  So it’s really all about ratios.  Grass fed average ration of omega-6:omega-3 is 1.53:1 which is MUCH more desirable than the grain-fed ratio of 7.65:1.

## Nutrient Density

The variety in an animal’s diet when it is free range and able to consume vegetation as opposed to feed from a bucket or trough is far superior.  Plants provide many of the precursors for vitamins in the meat that are lacking in the grain-fed animals.  Vitamin A in virtually absent in grain-fed beef, but ample in grass-fed. This is one of the reasons that grass-fed beef will have a more yellow color to the fat content of the meat.  That color can be a good indicator of the nutrient content of your meat.

Vitamin E, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase all protect our cells from oxidation, a precursor to cancer. Zinc, iron, potassium, phosphorus and sodium are also higher when your meal has had lived in the pasture. Vitamin E and beta-carotene also help to protect our meets when we fire up the grill and cook these at higher temperatures.  The only way I hope to ever consume a steak whether beef, bison, lamb or wild game.

These are just the benefits to grass-fed meats.  The detriments of the antibiotics, hormones and other chemicals found in grain-fed meats will be explored at another time. So are we really what we eat? Countries that consume more grass-fed beef than the USA are seeing less heart disease and cancer than we are.  So, yes.  We can expect to experience health similar to the foods we are consuming.  But I still think that poster defeated its own purpose.

I’d love to hear where you find your healthy grass-fed meats.  Please share below what you’re finding available in the area.  And if you ever find yourself with more wild game that freezer space you know who’ll make some room in their freezer!
