As you roll over to the edge of the bed, you glance at the clock. It reads 7:48 am.

_"Okay, I have 12 more minutes until my alarm."_ You ponder and roll back over.

Suddenly, it dawns on you that you’re supposed to wake up at 7:00 am not 8:00 am. You leap out of bed in a frenzy and your mood drops lower as each little hiccup occurs throughout the rest of the day.

<hr>

I once read a quote that stated, _"What consumes your mind, controls your life."_ It’s rough when your alarm doesn’t go off on time and you must rush to get out the door into the all the hustle and bustle called life. Honestly, at any time of the day something can happen that will throw us off our game and make things a bit more difficult.

What is most important is how we respond to the “hiccups” in our day. Do you focus on it so hard that it drains you during the rest of your day? Or do you look at it as life happens and move on not letting it effect your positivity? This is when that quote, _"What consumes your mind, controls your life"_ comes into play. I will admit I can be a bit of negative Nancy sometimes, but I am working on being a positive Patty. If I try to focus on the joys that are happening during my day, I will most likely overcome those hiccups and be able to positively influence people around me.
