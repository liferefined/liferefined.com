Look, I’m not going to tell you this is easier a second time around, but I am in a much better position
today than I was 15 years ago. I’m opening a Chiropractic office, from scratch, again. Whether it’s a new
practice member, a business colleague, or my family, everyone’s face is the same when they realize that
I’m not moving my former busy practice to a new location – I’ve completely let it go and am starting
over!

If you are a parent, you know how it feels to see success in something you’ve created. It’s a feeling that
can’t be explained and it makes all the hard work worthwhile. Then why let it go? Six years ago to this
very day my brother Dr. Cole and I sat through a business presentation in Hoboken, New Jersey as Dr.
Drubin talked about the difference between running a business and creating a legacy. On the flight back
to Indianapolis I knew the entrepreneur flame had finally been lit for Cole and at some point, in some
capacity, we would be running separate offices.

Several years of examining different strategies and reviewing countless options, we agreed that he’d
take over Lakeshore Chiropractic and I would move on to my next venture. My wife Staci and I were
ready to let go of our respective offices, that we have poured our heart and soul into making them
extremely successful, and start over. Would we buy an existing office and start with a book of practice
members or would we truly create the practice of our dreams from the ground up?

Dr. Staci and I have traveled the country visiting other Chiropractic offices helping them be more
successful for the last 5 years. I’ve seen Staci grab a screwdriver and remove adjusting room doors to
create some openness, because, as she said, “No one wants to get adjusted in a closet.” We’ve coached
staff in other offices when they were in need of some leadership and we’ve helped doctors become
more congruent with their core values. Let me tell you, having doctors tell you that they are better
Chiropractors is great, but when they tell you they are a better parent, spouse, and role model it lets
you know you’re changing lives.

So here we are, Life Refined Chiropractic is officially open, and we’ve got the responsibility, capacity and
drive to serve our profession and our community. It’s not easy to let go of something great, but in order
to realize the dream sometimes you have to start from scratch. Yesterday this exact idea was explored
at that same business meeting in Hoboken. A story of the #1 restaurant in the world, Eleven Madison
Park, and how they, while at the top of their game, closed the doors to re-emerge a better version of
themselves. (Learn more [about them here](https://tinyurl.com/y7pjoevv)) Ironically, Staci and I
happened upon that restaurant in 2016, while exploring the streets of NYC and sweettalked our way
into a table.

“Chance favors a prepared mind” Staci and I have planned every aspect of Life Refined Chiropractic and
found a team as excited as we are to serve you, our community, to help you realize your full 100%
potential. See you soon.
