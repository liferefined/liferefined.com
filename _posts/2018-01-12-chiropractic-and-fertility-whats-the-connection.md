There can be many reasons why a woman might find herself struggling with fertility concerns.  Each woman's story is a bit different - but our approach is universal.  Our goal is to assess the neurological system, and if we find deficiencies in how the brain is communicating to the reproductive organs (or any other part of the body, for that matter), establish a plan of care of chiropractic care aimed at restoring normal function. Chiropractic care is not a treatment for infertility, but rather an approach to reduce interference to the body's natural ability to heal and regulate. We also take into consideration nutritional changes and supplementation that might be beneficial in helping the body achieve it's highest level of health.
