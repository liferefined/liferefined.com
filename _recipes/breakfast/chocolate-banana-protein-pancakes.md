ingredients:
- 1 ripe banana
- 2 eggs
- 1 scoop chocolate protein powder (or cocoa powder)
instructions:
- In a blender, mix 1 ripe banana, 2 eggs, and 1 scoop of chocolate protein powder (or cocoa powder) until well blended together.
- On a griddle or in a frying pan, place a teaspoon of coconut oil and turn stove on to a low-medium. Scoop or pour SMALL amount of batter into the pan just like normal pancakes. These pancakes do tend to be flimsy so the smaller they are, the easier they will be to flip.
- Use a spatula to check underneath the pancakes while they cook in order to prevent burning. Each side should take about 2 minutes to cook.
