ingredients:
- 1 cup filtered water, divided
- 3 tbsp powdered gelatin
- 1 cup raw honey
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp salt
- Arrowroot starch to coat the outsides of the marshmallows
instructions:
- Grease an 8×8 inch pan and line in both directions with parchment paper (this way all sides covered). Leave about an inch to use as “handles” to lift the finished marshmallows.
- Dust parchment paper with arrowroot starch to avoid marshmallows being sticky on the bottom when they are removed.
- In a mixing bowl, add the gelatin with 1/2 cup of water.
- While the gelatin is softening, pour the other 1/2 cup of water in a sauce pan with honey, vanilla and salt. Turn the burner to a medium-high heat and bring mixture to a boil. Set a candy thermometer in the sauce pan and continue to boil the mixture until it reaches 240 degrees (the soft ball stage). This will take approx. 7-8 min. Immediately remove from the sauce pan from the heat.
- Turn your mixer to low/med. Slowly pour the sauce mixture into the bowl combining it with the softened gelatin. Set the mixer to high and continue beating until it becomes thick like marshmallow cream (about 10 min).
- Turn off the mixer and pour the marshmallow mixture into the parchment lined pan.
- Smooth the top with a rubber spatula and add another light dusting of arrowroot starch on the top.
- Cut a piece of parchment paper the size of your pan and top your marshmallow pan with it. Carefully press down the top with your hands to smooth out the cream (this ensures even marshmallows).
- Allow your marshmallows to “set” for 4-6 hours. Do NOT disturb! You’ll know it’s ready by pushing down and the texture is bouncy.
- Once your marshmallow has “set”, lift big marshmallow out onto a counter. Using a sharp knife, cut it into squares. Enjoy by themselves or with hot cocoa!
