ingredients:
- 1 spaghetti squash, cut in half (remove seeds)
- 1 lb. whole chicken (de-boned)
- 1 cup water
- 2 minced shallots
- 3 minced garlic cloves
- 1 tsp. minced or grated ginger
- 3 cups mung bean sprouts
- 1 cup julienned carrots
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- 4 sliced green onions
- Juice of 1 lime
- 2 tbsp. fish sauce or coconut aminos
- 2 tbsp. raw honey (optional)
- 1 tbsp. chili sauce (optional)
- 2 tbsp. almond butter
- 3 tbsp. coconut oil
- 1/4 cup chopped roasted nuts (optional)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
instructions:
- Add whole chicken to crock pot on low heat. Let cook for 5-7 hours.
- After chicken is able to be pulled apart, turn off crock pot and let sit. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
- Spread 1 tbsp. melted coconut oil on the inside flesh of the squash. Place both halves in the oven on a baking sheet, skin side up, and roast for about 40 min.
- Allow to cool then break the flesh apart with a fork to make the spaghetti squash “noodles”.
- In a small saucepan on low heat, combine and warm up the lime juice, fish sauce, honey, chili sauce, and almond butter. Stir everything in the pan until smooth.
- In a skillet on medium heat, add remaining coconut oil and melt. Then add the shallots, garlic, and ginger, and stir for two more minutes.
- Add the bean sprouts and carrots. Allow to cook for another minute.
- Pour the eggs into the center of the skillet, scramble then combine with the vegetables.
- Add in the spaghetti squash, almond butter sauce, green onions, cilantro, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Give everything one last big stir, garnish with the roast nuts, if using, and serve hot.
