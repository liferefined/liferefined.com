ingredients:
- 3 Tbsp coconut oil
- 2 small/medium sized sweet potatoes chopped
- 1 medium chopped onion
- 1 small/medium sized chopped bell pepper red, orange, or yellow
- 1/2 lb fresh bulk sausage sugar free
- 1/4-1/2 tsp paprika or smoked paprika
- Sea salt and black pepper to taste
- Optional, a pinch red pepper flakes for sausage
- 4 farm fresh eggs
instructions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees (will be used to bake the eggs in the skillet at the very end)
- Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of the coconut oil. Allow to melt. Once sizzling, crumble the sausage into the pan. Stir while cooking to evenly brown. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes if you'd like.
- When sausage is about 3/4 of the way done, add the chopped onions and peppers. Stir continually until the sausage is browned and the onions and peppers are tender and fragrant. Then remove from heat and set aside until the potatoes are done.
- Add the remaining 2 Tbsp of coconut oil to melt in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chopped sweet potatoes. Add a touch of smoked paprika, sea salt and pepper to taste.
- Continue to stir until the outside begins to brown, then cover the skillet (any cover that mostly fits will do!). Cook until the inside of the potatoes are tender while also uncovering to stir once in a while. Adjust the heat if necessary to prevent burning, and add a bit more coconut oil if necessary. This step should take about 7 minutes total, give or take.
- Once the potatoes are tender and browned, add them to the sausage mixture and stir to combine. Make 4 indents where you will crack each egg - then carefully crack the eggs into the spaces (I like to create a bit of space for the eggs so the yolks don't break and the whites don't run all over!)
- Put the whole skillet in the 400 degree oven to bake the eggs to your preference, about 10-15 minutes. You can also cook the eggs by covering the skillet and cooking over medium-low heat until the eggs are done. I prefer the oven method to avoid burning the bottom of the hash.

_**Note:** The sausage will be cooked in the same pan with the onions and peppers and the potatoes separately, until the end._
